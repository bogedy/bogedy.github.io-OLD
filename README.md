My website, with a simple Hugo theme based off of Lexi Hale's
[Êž.cc](http://xn--rpa.cc/). I liked her website, but I wanted to write pages in
markdown and automate things like header generation, so I translated her site
structure into a Hugo theme, using her style sheet that she was nice enough to
share.

If you would like to use this theme, you can either

- clone this repo, `rm -r content/*`, and start editing with `hugo new ...`, or
- copy `themes/k.cc` into your Hugo website's `themes` folder and update
  `config.toml`.

Then, be sure to go into `themes/k.cc/static/css/serenity.css` and change the
background color.
