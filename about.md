I graduated from Haverford College as a math major in 2020. I am currently residing in Boston and interning at Thomson Reuters labs where I do NLP research. I planned to start a masters in computer science at Tsinghua University last year before COVID got in the way. I am now taking a break, reading, working on projects and trying my hand at blogging.

My main interests are in statistics, data science, political economy and China. I also love biking and cooking. I hope I don't forget my Spanish and I'm currently learning Hebrew. 

For my senior thesis I wrote an expository paper on Markov Chain Monte Carlo Simulation where I explained the theory, basic concepts and worked through contrastive examples. Previously I've done research on unsupervised learning with Variational Autoencoders. I'm interested in contrastive learning, [here](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2018/file/093f65e080a295f8076b1c5722a46aa2-Paper.pdf) is a paper that I think is really cool.
