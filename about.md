I am a math graduate from Haverford College (2020) and an NLP data scientist contracting at a startup. In 2020 I was accepted to pursue a masters in computer science at Tsinghua University but COVID disrupted my plans.

My main areas of interest are statistics, data science, political economy and China. I also enjoy biking and cooking in my spare time. I speak Spanish, Mandarin Chinese and Hebrew.

For my senior thesis I wrote an expository paper on Markov Chain Monte Carlo Simulation where I explained the theory, basic concepts and worked through contrastive examples.
